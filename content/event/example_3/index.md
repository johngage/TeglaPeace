Images can be added in several ways:

1. by placing in branch folder, then naming "featured.jpg", or using \!\[\]\(\) markdown link to outside URL, as below
2. by placing in /assets/media/album, and referencing the album.
3. by using standard markdown reference, using name of .jpg file in branch folder
4. by placing the URL of the image on facebook in the '' behind the "url_code" key above; which results in a button, labeled "code"; other buttons are labeled "pdf" or "video"
5. by adding a "short code", which is a snippet of code used in Hugo, enclosed in {{}} brackets.
