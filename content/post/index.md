# Posts are longer articles about projects, plans, reports
- Blog posts should be for announcements, new projects, things that happen to the team, the academy, the foundation.  Daily diary sorts of posts.

- Posts should be for short articles about whatâ€™s going on, or reflections on the past, or longer pieces describing what the training program is for the Iten training session, or a summary of what happened as a result of AirBnB making a video, or an article about what is needed to improve the training track in Ngong.
