title: ABOUT US

---

TLPF is a charitable organization focused on **restoring peace and fostering economic empowerment among pastoralists in East Africa**. 

It was established in 2003 by Tegla Loroupe, a Kenyan marathon legend and the Foundation’s President. Essentially, TLPF works to rebuild social relations and develop trust among communities at war over scarce water, scarce pasture, and resources for their herds and crops. Climate change threatens increasingly fragile livelihoods and families in some of the world's most impoverished nomadic communities.

Twenty-one years of **Peace Races** have established sports as an alternative economic livelihood pathway to the warrior's traditional practice of cattle rustling. The Warrior's Training Center retrains those who put down their weapons and choose peace, offering opportunities in competing, training, ranching, farming, and other occupations.

The **Peace Races** gather a broad community, and are designed to increase awareness of girl child rights, to foster education, and champion peace and cooperation as the future for all tribes. Peace demands a fundamental change in the perception of pastoralists towards cattle raiding as a form of livelihood.

With a vision of *A Peaceful, Prosperous and Just World In Which Sports is a Unifying Factor*, the Foundation’s continued activities restore peace among warring pastoralists through sports, and build a foundation on which to make a difference in the lives of the less privileged. 

### Our Mission

To promote peaceful building of livelihoods and the resilience of poor people affected by violence and vulnerable to conflicts and civil strife in the world.

### Our Vision 

A peaceful, prosperous, and just world in which sports is a unifying and livelihood creating factor
