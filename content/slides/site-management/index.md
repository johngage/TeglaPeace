date: 2024-07-03T16:51:00.000Z

---
Main content repository is currently a public repository at https://github.com/johngage/TLPeaceFoundation.git
### Goal: move repository to location controlled by TLPF

---
 Establish how TLPF wants to:
 - Manage site structure; Manage site content
 - Who manages: 
   - Site Development: 
   - add images, new sections, new pages; add and edit posts; edit blog, events; edit staff (authors).

--- 
### Current editing workflow
- Use existing github repository editing; requires git knowledge
- Use Netlify site publishing; use CMS-DCap Netlify to edit content with no programming
- Use local VSCode content editing; use git for site updating; requires git knowledge
- Any change in git repository triggers Netlify rebuild of published site
---
### Decide on future workflow
- Use an additional existing Content Management System: Decap CMS
- Possibly introduce Obsidian environment for content editing
- restrict editing of Github repository to TLPF developers
- Need TLPF mangement controls; archiving, security, editorial control
